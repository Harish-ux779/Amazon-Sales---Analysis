Welcome to the Amazon Sales Analysis project! In this project, we delve into analyzing sales
data from Amazon to extract insights and trends that can help optimize sales strategies,
understand customer behavior, and improve business operations.
## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing Amazon sales records, including
information such as sales dates, customer details, product categories, and revenue figures. By
leveraging SQL queries and data analysis techniques, we aim to answer various questions and
uncover valuable insights from the dataset.
## Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project consists of [insert number] rows of data, representing Amazon
sales transactions. Along with the sales data, the dataset includes information about customers,
products, orders, and returns. Before analysis, the dataset underwent preprocessing to handle
missing values and ensure data quality.
## Analysis Questions Resolved
During the analysis, the following key questions were addressed using SQL queries and data
analysis techniques:

1. Find out the customer names,customer_ID and total number of returns and show the customer when the number of returs <=2 as "Low rx Customer" and returns between 2 to 5 as "Mid rx customer", rest of them as "High rx customer".
